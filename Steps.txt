I want to make a flask + Mongo task controller
at initial stage it only has 1 collection to store the tasks
later on, it should have an executors collections to store the executors

#1 Install Mongo 
  sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
  mongod -f mongod.conf
  
#2 Activate virtualenv
   virtualenv -p python3 venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
#3 Install flask
    echo "Flask=0.12" > requirements.txt
